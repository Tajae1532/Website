Collect news articles:
Use web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests or news APIs like NewsAPI or GNewsAPI to gather news articles related to tech and finance.

Summarize the articles:
Utilize NLP libraries like spaCy, Gensim, or Hugging Face Transformers to create abridged versions of the news articles.

Store the summarized articles and their metadata:
Create a database using SQLite or a more advanced solution like PostgreSQL to store the summarized articles, their original sources, and other metadata (e.g., publication date, author).

Create a backend using Flask or Django:
Build a web API to serve the summarized articles to the frontend. Flask or Django can help you create a RESTful API that interacts with your database and serves the content to your frontend.
